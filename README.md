# Troubleshooting

- If you can't get the server with `0.0.0.0:3000` you can use `localhost:3000` instead.
- If you have troubles with Docker, and itâ€™s not running when you run `docker-compose` up https://d.pr/v/J1G6Sk, you can try Quit docker or Restart Docker  https://d.pr/i/eKntOb. Open Docker again, and run `docker-compose up`.
- FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
Check your CPU and memory settings in Docker. Go to Docker `Desktop/Preferences` or `Settings/Resources` Increase the memory and CPU limit (keep in mind that this may affect your computer's performance, so make sure your computer has the capabilities to handle it without getting overwhelmed and don't set a limit higher than what your computer can support).
